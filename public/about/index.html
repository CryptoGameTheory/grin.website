<p>I am an economic researcher with a master degree in economic science. Since the beginning of my journey I’ve always wondered what is that strange thing we call <strong>money</strong>.</p>
<p>Money has always intrigued me because, if you think about it, it’s what unify us and divide us at the same time. We all wake up to earn money for a living and we all use money to exchange things and properties.</p>
<p>However, nobody really cares on how money works and people generally thinks about money as a given. Even academic institutions don’t give it enough credit (bad joke), while the books on the fundamentals of money are forgotten on some shelves.</p>
<p>During my studies, nevertheless, I discovered Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and I started to compare them with the traditional economies. This made me rediscover how the economy works. Some steps were for me enlightnening to understand money and the economics’ matter, therefore I’ve deepened my research.</p>
<p>After a while, another cryptocurrency caught my attention, <a href="https://grin.mw/"><strong>Grin</strong></a>, which I liked since the beginning. I share most of the principles that grin proposes and for that reason I’ve decided to work as a contributor for the community. You can understand the reasons while reading.</p>
<p>In this blog you will find <strong>open-source</strong> information about economics, data science and Grin, organized in such a way to be as much comprehensible as possible.</p>
<p>I hope that they will be <strong>enlightening</strong> for you as well.</p>
<div id="support" class="section level1">
<h1>Support</h1>
<p>Finding and reorganizing information takes a lot of time and work, but I don’t like to ask for money. I don’t know how this information can be useful to you, much less to give it a price.</p>
<p>Moreover, I believe that information should be <a href="http://gen.lib.rus.ec/">free</a> and accessible to everyone, regardless of the status. <strong>Some information are priceless, they enrich everyone.</strong></p>
<p>While I don’t expect anything in return, receiving grin or sats every now and then as a donation, is the strongest incentive there exists, for me.</p>
<p><strong>Donations are the free will of people that cares for the same things as you.</strong> Cryptocurrencies are perfect for that.</p>
<p>So, <em>iff</em> you find these contents interesting and useful, there are some ways in which you can help me to continue in this journey. Every tip could change my day. My aim is just to find a way to continue my studies and to build something meaningful for others.</p>

<p>*When I can I would switch to <a href="https://btcpayserver.org/">BTCpay Server</a>.</p>

<div id="teespring" class="section level4">

<p>Here you can buy some wearing items with a grin design.</p>

<div id="buy-books" class="section level4">
<h4>Buy books</h4>
<p>As an alternative, you can buy some must read books with my referral link.</p>
<p>If you prefer not to donate or you don’t have the means, don’t worry. <strong>We do what we can.</strong> But if you really care, at least make your voice heard. Sharing information could be essential too.</p>

<div id="how-the-site-was-thought" class="section level1">
<h1>How the site was thought</h1>
<p>All the parts of this site are <strong>open source</strong> and you can find them on <a href="https://github.com/CryptoGameTheory">Github</a> under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC License</a>.</p>
<p>To <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">build the site</a>, I’ve used Hugo, a framework for building fast websites (I left the defualt tutorials in the posts section), and the RStudio IDE, a platform to perform statistical analysis. The content is, therefore, written in Rmakdown (.Rmd) to allow interactive <a href="http://www.htmlwidgets.org/">widgets</a> and the R code to run.</p>
<p>This also makes the content suitable for reproduction. As I’ve said before, some information cannot be someone’s property, then, I encourage you to fork the site, change it, propose translations, or do whatever you want to spread the word. If you are new, just try and learn.</p>
<p>The site is build to be as flexible as possible, in such a way to be adapted and updated for future changes.</p>
<p>This is also a way to keep me fit and to exercise my computer skills. Writing down your works has two main benefits: first of all it allows you to resume the “mental steps” you took a long time ago; then, it allows others to look at your reasoning, speeding up the learning process. I have to thank so many writers!</p>
<p>The content is structured in this way:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docs:</strong> here you can find the resources where I get information and insipiration. A sort of bibliography of readings that changed my point of view.</li>
<li><strong>Grinomics:</strong> here you can start to see how deep is the rabbit hole. You can also find the economic principles that surround grin, cryptocurrencies and economics.</li>
<li><strong>Howtos:</strong> here you can find how to <em>“make your hands dirty”</em>. You would feel like an hacker!</li>
<li><strong>Posts:</strong> here you can find information about the growth of the community and other thoughts. I would make periodic reports and post them analyzing the progress.</li>
