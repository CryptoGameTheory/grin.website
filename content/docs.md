Here you can find the pivotal points for economics and cryptocurrencies, through the eyes of the big thinkers that shaped a lot of minds. All the content on the other sections points to these resources, that is, what is written takes inspiration from the books and documents you can find below. 

This page is divided in two parts. The first one is a selected path to understand as fast as possible what we are talking about. The second one is a list of resources divided in Economics, Cryptocurrencies and Other resources, where you can find all the related information. 

My suggestion is to read the articles first, then choose one of the books that inspires you the most!


### A possible path

1. Economic science 
2. Money
3. The history of money and banking
4. Technological change
5. The history of cryptocurrencies
6. Bitcoin
7. Grin & Mimblewimble
8. All the other articles that I'll find or that came in my mind
