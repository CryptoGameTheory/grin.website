<li><p>19 july 2016 Tom Elvis Jedusor released in the mailing list a file containing a new cryptographic feature useful for the blockchain. Omomorphic crypyography</p></li>
<li><p>Three months lates Andrew Polestra built the white paper.</p></li>
<li><p>It forms the first organization: Andrew which is gone, Ignotus peverell, the core team and the community</p></li>
<li><p>The 15 of january, two years later, the first implementation of Mimblewimble is released, it’s called Grin.</p></li>
<li><p>Initially grin was to be a side chain, however, due to the incompatibility with scripts of Bitcoin it launched a new blockchain.</p></li>
<li><p>Grin was launched in the most fair way possible. No premine, no ico, community based, different type of monetary policy with respect to Bitcoin.</p></li>
<li><p>Grin has no amounts and no addresses. It’s blockchain is based on kernels nodes transactions and prof of work.</p></li>
<li><p>The cryptographic primitives to understand Grin are the elliptic curves, the pedersen commitments and the coinjoin.</p></li>
<li><p>The proof of work in necessary for money because it requires some energy to be spent.</p></li>
<li><p>Grin has an advantage in the blockchain trilemma because is ligthweight and more private at the protocol level. It allows to have less decentralization.</p></li>
<li><p>The economics of grin are different to give everyone the opportunity to participate.</p></li>
<li><p>It has a simpler convention of 1 grin/s which is easier to understand and gives more stability.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s still in the early stage and needs a good infrastructure to be built.</p></li>
<li><p>Grin has a faster sync on the new peers</p></li>
<li><p>The two properties verified in a Mimblewimble transaction are: no new nodes created and the parties sending money must prove ownership of their keys.</p></li>
<li><p>Grin is similar to donations in non profit organizations, where only the two parts know the amount exchanged.</p></li>
<li><p>The Grin protocol is written in rust which is more secure.</p></li>
<li><p>The Grin blockchain is designed to grow with the number of users rather than the amount of transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>Grin is what Bitcoiners wanted since the beginning. An enormous mixer which keep transactions private.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no public ledger in Grin.</p></li>
<li><p>Initially grin was to be a side chain, however, due to the incompatibility with scripts of Bitcoin it launched a new blockchain.</p></li>
